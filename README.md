# Airline-Flight-Delay-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data to identify key factors contributing to flight delays and to build predictive models for delay classification. The analysis explores route-specific delays, weather dependencies, and temporal patterns (time of day, day of week, and seasonal trends) that impact airline performance.

Machine learning models, including Random Forest, are developed to classify delayed and on-time flights. To ensure model transparency and trust, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret predictions and identify the most influential features affecting delays, such as weather conditions, departure time, and route congestion.

Additionally, the project proposes an Operational Adjustability Index (OAI)—a composite metric designed to quantify an airline’s operational flexibility. This index helps airlines make informed decisions on resource allocation, scheduling, and delay mitigation strategies.

The project demonstrates the application of data analytics, machine learning, and explainable AI to solve real-world problems in airline operations and decision support.
